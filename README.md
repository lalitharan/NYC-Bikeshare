## Summary: 

From the different visualization stories, we can see that males take advantage of  the bike share facility the most. Interesting to note that more than 50% of the trip duration average at 5 minutes or under. For the month of August, the busiest hours are Thursdays between 5-6 pm , followed by Monday and Tuesday 5-6 pm.
We need to analyze additional months and years of data to identify if there are any trends in the timings and /or months that are consistently busy for bike share. That information would help us to understand if there are additional bikes needed for that time of the month or year. 
We can have a survey and analyze the results to check the general feedback, comfort, safety and experience of the bike riders and use that data to make informed decisions.
